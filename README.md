# MyWebsite
A project for creating my own custom website

* The idea of this project is to create a custom website, for myself of course

* how should the website look like? The basic idea is to have a fantasy woorld map, where each section is a location on the map.

* For eg, I plan to add a books section which keep track of my favorite books. I plan to correlate with the largest library in that world. 

* This is the major aim of course. The one in development may look far from the objective.
